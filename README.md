# konqi plush
documenting my process of making a custom plush of Konqi (the mascot of KDE)\
![all the prototypes of Konqi sitting behind a WIP final version.](https://cloud-jerdocjpo-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_7792.jpg)\

right now, this project is still a work in progress and will probably be finished at the end of arcade\
i'll be giving him to one of my close friends once i am finished ^.^\

some cool things:
* i am not using any machines to embroider or sew
* the custom pattern was made by referencing other plushies and using trial and error

## i wanna make one too!
right now, i can't modify the pattern to make it instructions-friendly. you'll have to wait until i get my laptop back from Tech support hell unfortunately.\
if you're a madlad and want to try anyways, [here is the pdf to my pattern.](https://cloud-m9k8pe0sc-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0png2pdf.pdf)
